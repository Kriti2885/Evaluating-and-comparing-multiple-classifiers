# Implementation, Evaluation and Comparison of multiple machine learning classification algorithms for two different datasets.

Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas

Dataset:
1. Adult dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
2. Hand gesture dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gesture+Phase+Segmentation#

Introduction:
The raw data was acquired, analyzed, cleaned up and preprocessed including missing data handling and normalization. 
The dimensionality reduction was done based on feature relevance calculated using ExtraTreeClassifier. The following Seven classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated: 
1. Naive Bayes Algorithm
2. Decision Tree
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Random Forest
5. Logistic Regression
6. ADA Boost
7. Support Vector Machine

The algorithm performance was evaluated using following metrics:
1. Accuracy
2. Balanced Accuracy
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F-1 Measure
6. Mathews Correlation Coefficient
7. AUC
8. Confusion Matrix

The comparison was done using Learning Curves.

Results: Please see the report.
